# PerPilot

## 📋 Project Overview

Large multi-model (LMM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with **personalized instructions**—those containing ambiguous, user-specific context—a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research.

This repository presents **PerPilot**, an innovative framework designed to address the critical gap in personalized instruction handling for next-generation mobile agents.

## 🔍 Core Challenge

Modern mobile agents face significant limitations when processing:

* Ambiguous user requests requiring contextual understanding

* User-specific instructions depends on personal preferences or historical interactions

* Task execution in diverse mobile scenarios with minimal intervention

## 💡 Our Solution

We introduce two key innovations to address these challenges:

### 1. PerInstruct Dataset

A novel human-annotated dataset featuring:

* Diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios

* Rich contextual information for training and evaluation

* Comprehensive coverage of real-world user interaction patterns

### 2. PerPilot Framework

A plug-and-play architecture powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to:

* Autonomously perceive personalized elements in user instructions

* Understand context-specific requirements

* Execute complex tasks with minimal user input

## 🚀 Key Features

PerPilot employs two complementary approaches for personalized task completion:

| Approach                        | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory-based Retrieval**      | Leverages historical user data to provide contextually relevant responses |
| **Reasoning-based Exploration** | Uses LLM-powered reasoning to handle novel or ambiguous instructions      |

Fully automatic execution and verification of instructions(new)

Task instructions can be added very easily

## 📊 Experimental Results

Our evaluations demonstrate that PerPilot:

* Effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention

* Progressively improves performance with continued use

* Outperforms existing mobile agents in context-aware task execution

* Establishes the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation agents

## 📝 Conclusion

PerPilot represents a significant step forward in creating more intuitive and user-centric mobile agents. By combining memory-based retrieval with advanced reasoning capabilities, our framework paves the way for more natural human-machine interaction in mobile environments.
